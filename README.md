OOPS in Nodejs

Certainly! Here are some interview questions related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Node.js, along with answers:

**1. What is Node.js, and how does it relate to OOP?**

   **Answer:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows server-side programming using JavaScript. While JavaScript is not a traditional OOP language, it supports OOP concepts through the use of objects, constructors, and prototypes. Developers can create classes and objects in Node.js using JavaScript's object-oriented features.

**2. How do you create a class in Node.js using ES6 classes?**

   **Answer:** In Node.js, you can create a class using ES6 class syntax. For example:

   ```javascript
   class Person {
     constructor(name) {
       this.name = name;
     }
     sayHello() {
       console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
     }
   }
   const person = new Person('John');
   person.sayHello();
   ```

**3. Explain the concept of inheritance in Node.js.**

   **Answer:** Inheritance in Node.js allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This can be achieved using the `extends` keyword to create subclasses. For example:

   ```javascript
   class Animal {
     speak() {
       console.log('Animal speaks');
     }
   }
   class Dog extends Animal {
     speak() {
       console.log('Dog barks');
     }
   }
   const dog = new Dog();
   dog.speak(); // Output: 'Dog barks'
   ```

**4. What is the role of the 'super' keyword in Node.js classes?**

   **Answer:** The `super` keyword is used to call the constructor of a parent class when creating an instance of a subclass. It ensures that the parent class is properly initialized. For example:

   ```javascript
   class Animal {
     constructor(legs) {
       this.legs = legs;
     }
   }
   class Dog extends Animal {
     constructor(legs, breed) {
       super(legs);
       this.breed = breed;
     }
   }
   ```

**5. How can you achieve encapsulation in Node.js?**

   **Answer:** Encapsulation can be achieved in Node.js through the use of class properties marked as private by convention. For example, you can prefix private properties with an underscore `_` to indicate that they should not be accessed directly.

   ```javascript
   class Person {
     constructor(name, _ssn) {
       this.name = name;
       this._ssn = _ssn; // Private property
     }
     getSSN() {
       return this._ssn; // Getter for private property
     }
   }
   ```

**6. Explain the concept of polymorphism in Node.js.**

   **Answer:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In Node.js, you can achieve polymorphism through method overriding. Subclasses can provide their own implementation of methods with the same name as those in the parent class.

   ```javascript
   class Animal {
     speak() {
       console.log('Animal speaks');
     }
   }
   class Dog extends Animal {
     speak() {
       console.log('Dog barks');
     }
   }
   ```

These questions and answers provide a foundation for discussing OOP concepts in Node.js during interviews. Depending on the specific role and requirements, interviewers may delve into more advanced OOP topics or Node.js-related questions.

# nodejs-oops

Certainly! Here are some interview questions related to classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Node.js:

**1. What is a class in Node.js, and how is it different from a function?**

   **Answer:** A class is a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods. In Node.js, classes are introduced in ES6 and provide a more structured way to define object constructors and prototypes compared to traditional constructor functions. Classes promote better organization and encapsulation of data and behavior.

**2. How do you define a class in Node.js using ES6 syntax?**

   **Answer:** A class in Node.js can be defined using the ES6 `class` keyword. For example:

   ```javascript
   class Person {
     constructor(name) {
       this.name = name;
     }
     sayHello() {
       console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
     }
   }
   ```

**3. Explain the concepts of constructors and methods in Node.js classes.**

   **Answer:** Constructors are special methods called when an instance of a class is created. They initialize object properties. Methods are functions defined within a class to perform actions or provide behavior. Constructors are defined with the `constructor` method, while other methods can be added to the class to provide functionality.

**4. What is the significance of the 'this' keyword in Node.js classes?**

   **Answer:** The `this` keyword refers to the current object (instance) within a class. It is used to access object properties and methods. For instance, `this.name` refers to the `name` property of the current instance.

**5. How do you achieve inheritance in Node.js classes?**

   **Answer:** Inheritance is achieved using the `extends` keyword to create a subclass that inherits properties and methods from a parent class. For example:

   ```javascript
   class Animal {
     speak() {
       console.log('Animal speaks');
     }
   }
   class Dog extends Animal {
     bark() {
       console.log('Dog barks');
     }
   }
   ```

**6. What is method overriding in Node.js classes?**

   **Answer:** Method overriding is the ability of a subclass to provide its own implementation for a method that is already defined in the parent class. It allows a subclass to modify or extend the behavior of inherited methods.

**7. How can you create private properties and methods in Node.js classes?**

   **Answer:** In Node.js, there's no native support for private properties or methods, but you can achieve a level of privacy through naming conventions. By prefixing properties or methods with an underscore (e.g., `_name`), you indicate that they are intended to be private.

**8. Explain the concept of static methods in Node.js classes.**

   **Answer:** Static methods are methods that belong to the class itself, rather than to instances of the class. They are defined using the `static` keyword and can be called on the class without creating an instance.

**9. What is the role of the 'super' keyword in Node.js classes?**

   **Answer:** The `super` keyword is used to call the constructor or methods of the parent class when creating an instance of a subclass. It ensures that the parent class is properly initialized and allows access to parent class methods in the subclass.

These questions cover the fundamentals of classes and OOP concepts in Node.js. Depending on the specific role and requirements, interviewers may ask more in-depth or scenario-based questions.


=========
# abstract classes
In TypeScript and Node.js, abstract classes are a feature that allows you to define classes as blueprints for other classes, but they cannot be instantiated themselves. Abstract classes provide a way to define common methods and properties that must be implemented by the subclasses (derived classes). They are particularly useful when you want to ensure that certain methods are present in all subclasses but do not provide a complete implementation in the abstract class.

Here's how to define and use abstract classes in TypeScript and Node.js:

```typescript
// Define an abstract class
abstract class Animal {
  abstract makeSound(): void; // Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses

  move(distance: number) {
    console.log(`This animal moved ${distance} units.`);
  }
}

// Subclass that extends the abstract class
class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("Woof! Woof!");
  }
}

// Subclass that extends the abstract class
class Cat extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("Meow!");
  }
}

// You cannot create an instance of an abstract class:
// const animal = new Animal(); // Error

// You can create instances of subclasses:
const dog = new Dog();
const cat = new Cat();

dog.move(10); // Output: "This animal moved 10 units."
dog.makeSound(); // Output: "Woof! Woof!"

cat.move(5); // Output: "This animal moved 5 units."
cat.makeSound(); // Output: "Meow!"
```

In the example above:

1. `Animal` is an abstract class that defines an abstract method `makeSound` and a concrete method `move`. Abstract methods are defined using the `abstract` keyword and must be implemented by any subclass.

2. `Dog` and `Cat` are subclasses that extend the `Animal` class. They provide concrete implementations of the abstract `makeSound` method, and they inherit the `move` method from the `Animal` class.

3. You cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly, but you can create instances of its subclasses.

Abstract classes are a powerful tool for defining a common interface and behavior that multiple related classes should adhere to. They help ensure consistency and reduce code duplication in your Node.js applications.

# OOPS
Certainly! Here are some interview questions related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript:

**1. What is TypeScript, and how does it relate to OOP?**

   **Answer:** TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that enhances the language with features like classes, interfaces, and type checking. It enables OOP principles in JavaScript by providing a more structured way to define classes, interfaces, and type annotations.

**2. How do you define a class in TypeScript, and what are the key components of a class definition?**

   **Answer:** In TypeScript, a class is defined using the `class` keyword. A class can have constructors, properties, methods, and access modifiers. TypeScript introduces strong typing, allowing you to specify types for properties and function parameters.

**3. What is an interface in TypeScript, and how does it relate to OOP?**

   **Answer:** An interface is a blueprint for defining the structure of an object. It specifies the properties and methods that a class implementing the interface must adhere to. Interfaces promote OOP principles like abstraction and encapsulation.

**4. Explain the concept of inheritance in TypeScript classes. How do you extend a class from another class?**

   **Answer:** Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. TypeScript supports inheritance through the `extends` keyword. A subclass can extend a parent class and override its methods.

**5. How does TypeScript implement access modifiers (public, private, and protected) in class members, and why are they important in OOP?**

   **Answer:** TypeScript provides access modifiers to control the visibility and accessibility of class members. `public` members are accessible from anywhere, `private` members are only accessible within the class, and `protected` members are accessible within the class and its subclasses. Access modifiers enforce the principles of encapsulation and data hiding in OOP.

**6. What is method overloading in TypeScript, and how is it used in OOP?**

   **Answer:** Method overloading is a TypeScript feature that allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. It enables you to provide different implementations for a method depending on the number or types of arguments. Overloading is used to achieve polymorphism and method signature variation.

**7. How can you achieve polymorphism in TypeScript classes, and what are the benefits of polymorphism in OOP?**

   **Answer:** Polymorphism in TypeScript is achieved through method overriding. Subclasses can provide their own implementation for methods inherited from a parent class. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass, promoting flexibility and code reusability.

**8. What are abstract classes and methods in TypeScript, and how do they relate to OOP?**

   **Answer:** Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own. They are used as base classes for other classes and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. Abstract classes promote the concept of abstraction and provide a blueprint for derived classes.

**9. Explain the concept of type inference in TypeScript and how it supports OOP principles.**

   **Answer:** Type inference in TypeScript automatically determines the data types of variables and function return values. This enhances OOP by enforcing strong typing, which leads to better code quality and early error detection.

**10. How does TypeScript support static methods, and what are their use cases in OOP?**

   **Answer:** TypeScript supports static methods through the `static` keyword. Static methods belong to the class itself and are not associated with instances. They are useful for utility functions or operations that don't depend on instance-specific data.

These questions cover a range of OOP concepts in TypeScript, from classes and interfaces to inheritance, access modifiers, and polymorphism. Interviewers may ask additional questions based on the specific requirements of the position and the level of expertise expected.

========

In TypeScript, you can define user types using the `type` keyword or the `interface` keyword, depending on your specific requirements. Both `type` and `interface` can be used to describe the shape of user-defined objects or data structures. Here are examples of how to define user types using both approaches:

**Using `type` to Define User Types:**

```typescript
// Define a user type for a Person
type Person = {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
  email?: string; // Optional property
};

// Usage of the Person type
const user1: Person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30,
};

const user2: Person = {
  firstName: "Jane",
  lastName: "Smith",
  age: 25,
  email: "jane@example.com",
};
```

In this example, we define a `Person` type using the `type` keyword. It describes the shape of a user object with properties like `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, and an optional `email` property.

**Using `interface` to Define User Types:**

```typescript
// Define a user type for a Person using an interface
interface Person {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: number;
  email?: string; // Optional property
}

// Usage of the Person interface
const user1: Person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30,
};

const user2: Person = {
  firstName: "Jane",
  lastName: "Smith",
  age: 25,
  email: "jane@example.com",
};
```

In this example, we define the `Person` type using the `interface` keyword. The usage of the `Person` type is the same as in the previous example.

Both `type` and `interface` can be used to define user types, and which one you choose often depends on your specific use case and coding style. `type` can be more flexible and can represent unions, intersections, and other complex types, while `interface` is often used when defining the shape of objects and classes.

When defining user types, it's important to use meaningful and descriptive names and ensure that your types accurately represent the data structures and objects in your application.

# **Difference Between Method Overriding and Method Overloading in JavaScript**

| Feature                | **Method Overriding**                                   | **Method Overloading**                                   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | A child class redefines a method inherited from the parent class. | Creating multiple methods with the same name but different parameter sets. |
| **Purpose**            | Used to provide a specific implementation of a method in a subclass. | Used to define multiple ways to perform a task depending on the number or type of arguments. |
| **Implementation**     | Achieved in JavaScript using **prototypal inheritance** or **ES6 classes**. | Not directly supported in JavaScript. Achieved by manually checking arguments or using default parameters. |
| **Runtime or Compile-time** | Happens at runtime (polymorphism).                   | Happens at compile-time in other languages, but JavaScript uses runtime checks. |
| **Use Case**           | Used in **inheritance** to modify the behavior of a parent class method. | Provides flexibility by defining multiple versions of a method for different inputs. |

---

### **Examples**

#### **1. Method Overriding Example**
Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method inherited from the parent class:

```javascript
class Parent {
    greet() {
        return "Hello from Parent!";
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    greet() {
        return "Hello from Child!";
    }
}

const obj = new Child();
console.log(obj.greet()); // Output: "Hello from Child!"
```

- **Explanation**: The `greet` method in the `Child` class overrides the `greet` method in the `Parent` class. This happens at runtime, allowing the subclass to provide its own specific implementation.

---

#### **2. Method Overloading Example**
JavaScript does not natively support method overloading as in some other programming languages like Java or C#. However, it can be simulated using techniques like argument checking or default parameters:

```javascript
class Calculator {
    calculate(a, b) {
        if (b !== undefined) {
            return a + b; // If two arguments are passed, perform addition.
        }
        return a * a; // If one argument is passed, return its square.
    }
}

const calc = new Calculator();
console.log(calc.calculate(5)); // Output: 25
console.log(calc.calculate(5, 3)); // Output: 8
```

- **Explanation**: The `calculate` method in this example behaves differently depending on the number of arguments passed. This simulates method overloading by using runtime checks to determine the desired behavior.

---

### Key Points:
- **Method Overriding** is achieved through inheritance and allows a subclass to modify the behavior of a parent class method.
- **Method Overloading** in JavaScript is not natively supported but can be implemented using techniques like argument checking or default parameters to provide multiple ways to perform a task based on the inputs.

# **Static Methods in Node.js**

Static methods in Node.js (and JavaScript in general) are methods defined on a class that belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. These methods are often used to create utility functions or operations that don't depend on any instance-specific data.

### **Characteristics of Static Methods**
1. Defined using the `static` keyword.
2. Called directly on the class, not on an instance of the class.
3. Cannot access instance properties or methods directly (because they are not tied to an instance).
4. Can access other static properties or methods within the class.

---

### **Example of Static Methods in Node.js**
```javascript
class Calculator {
    // Static method for addition
    static add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Static method for subtraction
    static subtract(a, b) {
        return a - b;
    }

    // Regular method (instance-specific)
    multiply(a, b) {
        return a * b;
    }
}

// Calling static methods directly on the class
console.log(Calculator.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
console.log(Calculator.subtract(10, 4)); // Output: 6

// Cannot call static methods on an instance
const calc = new Calculator();
try {
    console.log(calc.add(5, 3)); // Error: calc.add is not a function
} catch (err) {
    console.log(err.message);
}

// Regular instance-specific methods can be called on instances
console.log(calc.multiply(2, 3)); // Output: 6
```

---

### **When to Use Static Methods**
1. **Utility Functions**: Functions that don't depend on the state of an instance, such as calculations or formatting.
2. **Helper Methods**: Methods that provide reusable logic for multiple parts of your application.
3. **Factory Methods**: Static methods that return new instances of a class.

---

### **Static Methods in Node.js Context**
Static methods are commonly used in Node.js to encapsulate logic in a utility class or when designing services or libraries.

#### Example: Utility Class
```javascript
class StringUtil {
    static capitalize(str) {
        return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
    }

    static reverse(str) {
        return str.split("").reverse().join("");
    }
}

// Usage
console.log(StringUtil.capitalize("hello")); // Output: "Hello"
console.log(StringUtil.reverse("world"));    // Output: "dlrow"
```

#### Example: Database Service
```javascript
class DatabaseService {
    static connect(dbUrl) {
        console.log(`Connecting to database at ${dbUrl}...`);
        // Logic for connecting to the database
    }
}

// Usage
DatabaseService.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb");
```

---

### **Advantages**
- **Encapsulation**: Groups utility functions logically within a class.
- **Code Reuse**: Can be reused without creating instances.
- **Clean Design**: Prevents unnecessary instance creation for methods that don't rely on instance-specific data.

---

### **Limitations**
1. Cannot access instance-specific properties or methods.
2. Overusing static methods may lead to procedural-like design instead of object-oriented.

Static methods are powerful tools in Node.js for designing clean, reusable, and modular code.

# **Helper Functions in TypeScript**

Helper functions are reusable utility functions that simplify complex tasks or provide commonly used logic in an application. In TypeScript, these functions can be defined with type safety, ensuring that the inputs and outputs are strongly typed, which reduces runtime errors.

---

### **Characteristics of Helper Functions**
1. **Reusable**: Provide logic that can be reused across the application.
2. **Type-Safe**: Leverage TypeScript's static typing to ensure correct function usage.
3. **Modular**: Can be organized in separate files or modules for better maintainability.
4. **General Purpose**: Often solve generic problems like formatting, validation, or calculations.

---

### **Examples of Helper Functions in TypeScript**

#### **1. String Utilities**
```typescript
export class StringHelper {
    static capitalize(str: string): string {
        return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1).toLowerCase();
    }

    static reverse(str: string): string {
        return str.split('').reverse().join('');
    }
}

// Usage
console.log(StringHelper.capitalize("hello")); // Output: "Hello"
console.log(StringHelper.reverse("world"));    // Output: "dlrow"
```

---

#### **2. Array Utilities**
```typescript
export class ArrayHelper {
    static findMax(numbers: number[]): number | null {
        if (numbers.length === 0) return null;
        return Math.max(...numbers);
    }

    static unique<T>(arr: T[]): T[] {
        return Array.from(new Set(arr));
    }
}

// Usage
console.log(ArrayHelper.findMax([3, 5, 1, 9])); // Output: 9
console.log(ArrayHelper.unique([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4])); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

---

#### **3. Date Utilities**
```typescript
export class DateHelper {
    static formatDate(date: Date): string {
        return date.toISOString().split('T')[0];
    }

    static daysBetween(date1: Date, date2: Date): number {
        const diff = Math.abs(date1.getTime() - date2.getTime());
        return Math.ceil(diff / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
    }
}

// Usage
console.log(DateHelper.formatDate(new Date())); // Output: "YYYY-MM-DD"
console.log(DateHelper.daysBetween(new Date("2024-12-20"), new Date("2024-12-25"))); // Output: 5
```

---

#### **4. Validation Utilities**
```typescript
export class ValidationHelper {
    static isEmailValid(email: string): boolean {
        const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
        return emailRegex.test(email);
    }

    static isPhoneNumberValid(phone: string): boolean {
        const phoneRegex = /^\+?[1-9]\d{1,14}$/; // E.164 format
        return phoneRegex.test(phone);
    }
}

// Usage
console.log(ValidationHelper.isEmailValid("test@example.com")); // Output: true
console.log(ValidationHelper.isPhoneNumberValid("+1234567890")); // Output: true
```

---

### **Best Practices for Helper Functions**
1. **Type Definitions**:
   - Use TypeScript's type annotations to ensure clarity and safety.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     static sum(a: number, b: number): number {
         return a + b;
     }
     ```

2. **Organize by Functionality**:
   - Group related helper functions into separate classes or files, e.g., `StringHelper`, `DateHelper`.

3. **Use Generic Types**:
   - Use TypeScript generics to make functions reusable for multiple types.
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     static getFirstElement<T>(arr: T[]): T | undefined {
         return arr[0];
     }
     ```

4. **Modular Approach**:
   - Export helper classes or functions from separate modules to keep the codebase clean.

---

### **Summary**
Helper functions in TypeScript improve code reusability, type safety, and maintainability. Whether for formatting, validation, or other utility purposes, they are an essential part of building scalable and clean TypeScript applications. By combining modularity and strong typing, they ensure better code quality and fewer bugs.

# **Type Definitions in TypeScript**

Type definitions in TypeScript provide a way to define the shape, structure, and type constraints of data within your application. They enhance code quality by enabling static type checking, ensuring that data types align with expectations during development.

---

### **Key Features of Type Definitions**
1. **Type Safety**: Ensures variables, function arguments, and return values match the expected types.
2. **Autocompletion**: Provides better IDE support with intelligent suggestions.
3. **Readability**: Makes code self-documenting by explicitly stating the structure of data.
4. **Error Detection**: Identifies mismatches or invalid type usages at compile time.

---

### **Types of Type Definitions**

#### **1. Basic Type Annotations**
Define the type of a variable or function return value.

```typescript
let age: number = 25;
let name: string = "Alice";
let isAvailable: boolean = true;

function add(x: number, y: number): number {
    return x + y;
}
```

---

#### **2. Object Type Definitions**
Define the structure of objects using type annotations.

```typescript
let user: { name: string; age: number; isAdmin: boolean } = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    isAdmin: true,
};
```

---

#### **3. Custom Type Aliases**
Create reusable and named types for complex structures.

```typescript
type User = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    isAdmin: boolean;
};

const admin: User = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 28,
    isAdmin: true,
};
```

---

#### **4. Interfaces**
Similar to type aliases but specifically for describing object structures. They are extendable and commonly used to define contracts for classes.

```typescript
interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    isAdmin?: boolean; // Optional property
}

const member: User = {
    name: "Bob",
    age: 35,
};
```

---

#### **5. Function Type Definitions**
Define the shape of a function, including argument and return types.

```typescript
type Add = (a: number, b: number) => number;

const add: Add = (x, y) => x + y;
```

---

#### **6. Array Type Definitions**
Specify the type of elements in an array.

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let strings: Array<string> = ["hello", "world"];
```

---

#### **7. Union Types**
Allow a variable to hold multiple types.

```typescript
let id: number | string = 123;
id = "abc";
```

---

#### **8. Intersection Types**
Combine multiple types into one.

```typescript
type Person = { name: string };
type Employee = { id: number };

type Staff = Person & Employee;

const worker: Staff = {
    name: "Jane",
    id: 101,
};
```

---

#### **9. Generics**
Create reusable components with type flexibility.

```typescript
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
    return value;
}

console.log(identity<number>(42)); // Output: 42
console.log(identity<string>("Hello")); // Output: "Hello"
```

---

#### **10. Enum Types**
Define a set of named constant values.

```typescript
enum Role {
    Admin,
    User,
    Guest,
}

const userRole: Role = Role.Admin;
```

---

### **Practical Use Cases**
1. **Defining API Responses**:
   ```typescript
   interface ApiResponse {
       data: object;
       status: number;
       error?: string;
   }

   function fetchApi(): ApiResponse {
       return { data: {}, status: 200 };
   }
   ```

2. **Defining Class Contracts**:
   ```typescript
   interface Shape {
       calculateArea(): number;
   }

   class Rectangle implements Shape {
       constructor(private width: number, private height: number) {}
       calculateArea(): number {
           return this.width * this.height;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Reusable Type Definitions for Libraries**:
   TypeScript libraries often come with type definition files (`.d.ts`) to provide type information for their APIs.

---

### **Summary**
Type definitions in TypeScript make code safer, more readable, and maintainable by explicitly defining the types of variables, objects, functions, and more. By leveraging advanced features like interfaces, generics, and unions, you can build scalable and type-safe applications.



# _ vs  # for private properties of class

In TypeScript, you can use either `_` (by convention) or `#` (native to JavaScript) for private properties, but they serve different purposes:

### **1. Using `_` for Private Properties (By Convention)**
- This is a widely used convention in JavaScript and TypeScript to indicate a property is private.
- It is **not enforced by the language**; the property is still accessible outside the class.

Example:
```typescript
class Person {
  private _name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this._name = name;
  }

  getName(): string {
    return this._name;
  }
}

const person = new Person("John");
console.log(person.getName()); // Allowed
// console.log(person._name); // Still accessible but against convention
```

---

### **2. Using `#` for Private Properties (Native Private Fields)**
- This is a JavaScript feature that TypeScript supports.
- Properties with `#` are truly private and cannot be accessed outside the class, even accidentally.

Example:
```typescript
class Person {
  #name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.#name = name;
  }

  getName(): string {
    return this.#name;
  }
}

const person = new Person("John");
console.log(person.getName()); // Allowed
// console.log(person.#name); // Error: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class
```

---

### **Key Differences**
| Feature                | `_` Convention          | `#` Private Field      |
|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Accessibility          | Can still be accessed outside (not truly private) | Completely private |
| Enforcement            | Relies on developer discipline | Enforced by the language |
| Supported Environments | Works in all JavaScript engines | Requires ES6+ support |

**Recommendation:** Use `#` for strict privacy, but if backward compatibility is required, stick with the `_` convention.


# Class vs Interface

In TypeScript (and many other object-oriented programming languages like Java), both classes and interfaces are used to define the structure of objects, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

### 1. **Class**
- **Purpose**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects with defined properties and methods. It can contain both the declaration of properties and the implementation of methods.
- **Instantiation**: You can create instances of a class using the `new` keyword.
- **Constructors**: Classes can have constructors to initialize objects when they are created.
- **Access Modifiers**: Classes can have access modifiers like `public`, `private`, and `protected` to define visibility for properties and methods.
- **Inheritance**: Classes can extend other classes and implement interfaces, supporting inheritance.

```typescript
class Car {
  private color: string;
  
  constructor(color: string) {
    this.color = color;
  }

  drive() {
    console.log('Driving a', this.color, 'car');
  }
}

const myCar = new Car('red');
myCar.drive(); // Output: Driving a red car
```

### 2. **Interface**
- **Purpose**: An interface defines the structure (types) of objects, but it does not provide implementation. It is purely used for type-checking and ensures that a class or object adheres to a particular structure.
- **Instantiation**: You cannot create an instance of an interface directly. It is used to enforce type constraints on classes or objects.
- **No Implementation**: Interfaces only define the signatures of methods and properties, not their behavior.
- **Inheritance**: Interfaces can extend other interfaces but cannot implement them (unlike classes).
  
```typescript
interface Drivable {
  drive(): void;
}

class Car implements Drivable {
  drive() {
    console.log('Driving a car');
  }
}

const myCar = new Car();
myCar.drive(); // Output: Driving a car
```

### Key Differences:
| Feature            | Class                                  | Interface                               |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Defines both properties and methods, and provides implementation | Defines the structure (types) of objects without implementation |
| **Instantiation**   | Can be instantiated (using `new`)      | Cannot be instantiated                 |
| **Implementation**  | Can provide method implementations    | Only defines method signatures, no implementations |
| **Modifiers**       | Can use access modifiers (`public`, `private`, etc.) | Does not have access modifiers         |
| **Inheritance**     | Can extend other classes and implement interfaces | Can extend other interfaces, but cannot implement classes |

### When to use:
- **Use a class** when you need to create objects with behavior (methods) and shared state (properties).
- **Use an interface** when you want to define a contract for objects or classes, specifying what methods or properties they must implement, but not how they should implement them.

# Access Modifiers in TypeScript

In TypeScript, **access modifiers** are used to control the visibility and accessibility of class members (properties and methods). There are three main access modifiers: `public`, `private`, and `protected`. These modifiers allow you to define the scope in which a class member can be accessed, both inside and outside the class.

### 1. **`public`** (Default)
- **Purpose**: Members marked as `public` are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.
- **Default Modifier**: If no modifier is specified, the member is treated as `public` by default.
  
```typescript
class Person {
  public name: string;
  
  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const person = new Person('Alice');
console.log(person.name); // Accessible outside the class
person.greet(); // Accessible outside the class
```

### 2. **`private`**
- **Purpose**: Members marked as `private` are only accessible within the class in which they are defined. They cannot be accessed from outside the class or even from derived classes.
  
```typescript
class Person {
  private name: string;
  
  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  private greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }

  public sayHello() {
    this.greet(); // Accessible inside the class
  }
}

const person = new Person('Alice');
console.log(person.name); // Error: 'name' is private and cannot be accessed outside the class
person.greet(); // Error: 'greet' is private and cannot be accessed outside the class
person.sayHello(); // Works fine, since greet() is accessed from within the class
```

### 3. **`protected`**
- **Purpose**: Members marked as `protected` are accessible within the class and by subclasses (derived classes), but not from outside the class hierarchy.
  
```typescript
class Person {
  protected name: string;
  
  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  protected greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  constructor(name: string) {
    super(name);
  }

  public employeeGreet() {
    this.greet(); // Accessible inside derived class
    console.log(`Welcome, ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const employee = new Employee('Bob');
employee.employeeGreet(); // Works fine, since greet() is accessed from the derived class
console.log(employee.name); // Error: 'name' is protected and cannot be accessed outside the class or derived classes
```

### Summary of Access Modifiers:
| Access Modifier | Description                                | Accessible From                           |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **`public`**    | Default modifier. Accessible everywhere.   | Inside the class, outside the class, derived classes |
| **`private`**   | Accessible only within the class itself.   | Only inside the class                    |
| **`protected`** | Accessible inside the class and derived classes. | Inside the class, derived classes       |

### Special Case: **Shorthand for Public Properties**
In TypeScript, you can define public properties directly in the constructor with shorthand syntax:

```typescript
class Person {
  constructor(public name: string) {}

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const person = new Person('Alice');
console.log(person.name); // Accessible outside the class
```
This is equivalent to:

```typescript
class Person {
  public name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }
}
```

### Use Cases:
- **`public`**: When you want class members to be accessible by anyone.
- **`private`**: When you want to hide implementation details and prevent external access to certain properties or methods.
- **`protected`**: When you want a member to be available to the class and its subclasses, but not to outside code.

# Type vs Interface

In TypeScript, both **`type`** and **`interface`** are used to define the structure of objects, but they have some key differences and use cases. While they are often interchangeable in many scenarios, there are distinctions that influence which one you should use.

### Key Differences Between `type` and `interface`

| Feature               | **`type`**                                       | **`interface`**                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Declaration Syntax** | Can describe objects, unions, intersections, and more. | Primarily used to describe object shapes and can extend other interfaces. |
| **Extending**          | Can extend via intersections (`&`).             | Can extend via `extends`. Can also extend multiple interfaces. |
| **Merging**            | No declaration merging (cannot redefine a type with the same name). | Supports declaration merging (multiple definitions of the same interface are merged). |
| **Primitive Types**    | Can represent primitive types, unions, and intersections. | Primarily used for defining the structure of objects, not for primitive types. |
| **Computation**        | Can use mapped types, conditional types, and more advanced type manipulations. | Limited to defining object shapes but can extend other interfaces. |
| **Use Case**           | More flexible, used for complex types like unions and intersections. | Better suited for defining object structures and class contracts. |
| **Compatibility**      | Types and interfaces are mostly compatible but have different behaviors for advanced use cases. | More specialized for objects, especially when defining class-like structures. |

### 1. **`type`** (Type Alias)
- **Purpose**: `type` can represent any valid TypeScript type, including primitives, unions, intersections, and tuples. It is flexible and can be used for more complex type manipulations.
- **Syntax**: 
```typescript
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```

- **Union Types**:
```typescript
type ID = string | number;
```

- **Intersection Types**:
```typescript
type Employee = Person & { department: string };
```

- **Tuple Types**:
```typescript
type Coordinates = [number, number];
```

### 2. **`interface`**
- **Purpose**: `interface` is primarily used to define the structure of objects, and it is often used to describe contracts for classes or objects. It can extend other interfaces and be merged.
- **Syntax**:
```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

- **Extending Interfaces**:
```typescript
interface Employee extends Person {
  department: string;
}
```

- **Merging**:
  If you declare an interface with the same name multiple times, they will be merged into one interface.

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
}
  
interface Person {
  age: number;
}

const person: Person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 25
}; // Works fine because Person is merged
```

### When to Use `type` vs `interface`:

#### **Use `interface`** when:
- You are defining the structure of an object or class, especially if it needs to be used in object-oriented programming or extended by other classes or interfaces.
- You want to take advantage of **declaration merging** (e.g., adding new properties to an interface).
- You want to define shapes for objects that will be implemented by classes.

#### **Use `type`** when:
- You need to define more complex types like **unions** or **intersections** (e.g., combining multiple types together).
- You want to define **tuples**, **mapped types**, or **conditional types**.
- You are working with types that may include primitives or other non-object types.

### Example Comparison

```typescript
// Using `interface`
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Employee extends Person {
  department: string;
}

const employee: Employee = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  department: "HR"
};

// Using `type`
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type Employee = Person & { department: string };

const employee: Employee = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  department: "HR"
};
```

### Special Features of Each:

#### `type`:
- Can represent **unions** and **intersections**.
- Can represent **primitive types**, **tuples**, **mapped types**, and more advanced constructs.
- Cannot be merged (you cannot declare a type twice with the same name).

#### `interface`:
- Supports **declaration merging**.
- Can be extended using the `extends` keyword.
- Better for object-oriented programming and when defining objects that will be implemented by classes.

### Conclusion:
- **Use `interface`** when defining object shapes, especially for objects that will be extended or implemented.
- **Use `type`** when dealing with complex types like unions, intersections, tuples, or when you need more flexibility.
